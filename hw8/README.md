Legenda:
- blue: explicit euler
- red: semi implicit euler
- green: verlet

Completed tasks:

- Explicit Euler simulation (blue)
  - diverge after several minutes
- Semi Implicit Euler simulation (red)
  - do not diverge, but will not stop trembling
- 


P.S.
- The formula for explicit Euler method seems to have a wrong sign. The substraction sign may be needed to removed? 
  - After removing it, my simulation is able to run normaly.
